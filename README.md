# AbbaTek - *Where Ingenuity meets Passion*
At **AbbaTek**, we are driven by Community Science initiatives whose main goal is to create that perfect harmony between science and communities. 

Our inspiration emanated from [ASTCâ€™s Community Science Initiative](https://www.astc.org/impact-initiatives/astcs-community-science-initiative/) who defined it as **connected or organized groups of people who share a common geography, jurisdiction, set of characteristics, or interests and goals. This increasingly popular method of collaboration gives science-engagement practitioners and scientists the opportunity to collaborate with community members to do science that advances community priorities** 

# Polymer diversity in microplastics 
In an article led by [Chelsea Rochman](https://doi.org/10.1002/etc.4371) rethinking microplastics as a diverse contaminant suite, they emphasized the need for a change of thought about microplastics being a single contaminant rather than a diverse suite of contaminants in order to design efficient monitoring protocols, methods of analysis, assessmen of toxicity, source and fate, including efficient communication strategies for policy makers.

Now, here comes **CompoundConnect!** 

# CompoundConnect
This is an introductory repository of our proposed solution to help microplastic researchers, in that it provides an open access tool to match spectra with a library of polymers. At present, these libraries are mostly behind a paywall which can be difficult for researchers if they do not have the resources to purchase subscriptions.
The full package of being able to collect characterization data on size, shape, color and plastic type in one package is unique! There is also a real need for tools that are specific to microplastics, and particularly those similar to what we find in nature. This tool seems very relevant to microplastic researchers.

This code will be used in the 2020 Lake Winnipeg AquaHacking Challenge Final event on October 17 [here](https://aquahacking.com/en/2020-winnipeg/)
